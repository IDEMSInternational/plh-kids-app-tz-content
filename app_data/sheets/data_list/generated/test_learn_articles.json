You don’t need a lot of time - even 10 minutes a day can make a big difference. Here’s how:\n\nMake time to spend with your child one-on-one. Try to minimise distractions and interruptions.\n\nJoin your child in their world by getting down on your child’s level. Sit close to them to make it a shared experience.\n\nLet your child decide what to play and how to play. Don’t try to change what they are doing or instruct them. Instead, follow their lead. \n\nDuring the activity, observe and listen. Pay attention to what your child is doing or saying. Be curious about what they might be thinking and feeling.   \n\nRespond to what your child is doing with enthusiasm and praise. You could say: I see you are enjoying playing with these blocks. Wow! You are building such a tall and strong wall!\n\nJoining your child in their world and giving them your full attention helps them feel close and connected to you. This helps you build a strong relationship with your child. A strong relationship with you will help them to have healthy relationships with others in the future.",
