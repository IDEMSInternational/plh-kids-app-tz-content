We face many distractions, concerns, and challenges that make it difficult to connect with our children. In addition - our children might do or say things that we find frustrating and draining. Many parents feel this way!\n\nWe have something you can try. And the best thing about this is - you don’t need a lot of time - even 10 minutes a day makes a big difference. \n\nIt’s something that can:\n*   help your child feel seen and important\n*   help you to connect and relax with your child\n\nIt can even be a chance for you to step away from what causes you stress, to take a moment to pause and play.\n\nToday we shall learn more about one-on-one time. It is especially helpful when your child is being difficult / having a hard time. This is a great strategy for when your child is struggling or when you or your child are having a difficult time. Often when our children are struggling or being difficult, we actually don’t want to spend time with them. But struggling on the outside is a sign that our children are struggling on the inside. And if any of us are struggling on the inside, it helps to get more love and attention. If your child is struggling – more one on one time in this way can be like medicine, even if it sometimes feel harder for you to do."
